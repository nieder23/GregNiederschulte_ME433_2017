This repository is the collection of my work for the class ME 433 at Northwestern University, called Advanced Mechatronics. The class has us complete various projects to teach the skills involved in mechatronics design and programming. We wrap up the quarter with a project of a robotic cart that can follow a line on a course using a programmed Android device.
